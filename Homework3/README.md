This repository contains my Homework 3 for ECEN 127, where I implemented and tested a serial sequence detector in Verilog. The design uses a five-state finite state machine to monitor a 1-bit input stream and assert a match signal when the target bit pattern is observed, while the accompanying testbench generates clock and reset signals, applies example input sequences, and prints simulation output to verify correct state transitions and detection behavior.
