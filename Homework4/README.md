This repository contains my Homework 4 for ECEN 127, where I implemented and verified a synchronous FIFO buffer and a small register file in Verilog. The FIFO design supports enqueue/dequeue operations with full/empty status flags, while the register file provides multi-word storage with addressable read/write ports. A dedicated testbench exercises reset behavior, corner cases, and normal operation to confirm correct data movement and flag behavior in simulation.
