This repository contains my Lab 1 project for ECEN 127, where I implemented and tested basic combinational logic blocks in Verilog. The lab defines a 3-bit to 7-segment “alphabet” decoder that maps 3-bit codes to specific 7-segment patterns, a 4-to-1 multiplexer that selects among four 3-bit character values, and a testbench that drives different input combinations and observes the resulting seven-segment outputs.
