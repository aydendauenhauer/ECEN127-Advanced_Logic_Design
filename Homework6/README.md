This repository contains my Homework 6 for ECEN 127, where I implemented and verified a small library of Verilog modules, including a 32-to-1, 1-bit multiplexer and a composite counter that compares a 4-bit up-counter and 5-bit down-counter and asserts an output when their values match. The project includes behavioral source files, gate-level synthesis results, and dedicated testbenches that exercise reset, enable, and various select/data patterns, along with a compile script for running simulations in Synopsys VCS.
