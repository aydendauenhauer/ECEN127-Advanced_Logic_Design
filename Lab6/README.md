This repository contains my Lab 6 project for ECEN 127, where I implemented and verified memory interface modules in Verilog, including an SPI controller that communicates with an M23A640 serial memory model and an SRAM controller for a parallel memory interface. The testbenches generate read/write transactions, drive chip-select and clock signals, and check that data is correctly stored and retrieved over both serial and parallel buses.
