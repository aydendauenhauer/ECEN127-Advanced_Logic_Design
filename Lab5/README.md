This repository contains my Lab 5 project for ECEN 127, where I implemented a Verilog finite state machine for a simple “farmer river-crossing” game. The game module tracks the puzzle state as the farmer moves (optionally with entities) between banks, asserts win, lose, and impossible flags for solved, unsafe, or illegal configurations, and outputs a 4-bit encoded state, while the game_tb testbench drives clock/reset, applies sequences of moves, and prints simulation traces to verify all transitions and terminal conditions.
