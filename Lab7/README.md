This repository contains my Lab 7 project for ECEN 127, where I implemented a digital waveform generator and verification flow in Verilog and Python. The hardware side includes a phase accumulator, phase register, sine wavetable ROM initialized by a Python script that writes rom.hex, an interpolator, rounder, and ALU-based datapath that produce a stream of output samples. The C reference model generates c_output.csv, while the Verilog testbench writes verilog_output.csv, and a comparison script checks sample-by-sample agreement to confirm functional equivalence.
