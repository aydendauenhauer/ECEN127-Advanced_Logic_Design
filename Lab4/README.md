This repository contains my Lab 4 project for ECEN 127, where I implemented and tested a Verilog finite state machine to control a set of left and right “turn signal” lights. The lights module takes a 2-bit stalk input and clock/reset signals, then sequences the inner/middle/outer LEDs on each side to emulate automotive turn indicators, returning to an idle state when the stalk is centered or invalid. A testbench generates the clock, applies reset, and drives different stalk positions to verify the timing and patterns of all six light outputs in simulation.
