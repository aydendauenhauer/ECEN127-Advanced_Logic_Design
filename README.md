# ECEN127-Advanced_Logic_Design
This repository contains my ECEN 127 – Advanced Logic Design lab projects, implemented in Verilog at Santa Clara University. The goal of these labs is to practice advanced digital design concepts, including finite state machines, pipelined datapaths, memory interfaces, bus protocols, and structured verification using simulation and testbenches. The repository includes source files for the lab implementations as well as any helper modules, constraint files. This project is shared for personal reference and portfolio purposes only. If you are currently enrolled in ECEN 127, please do not copy this work or submit it as your own. Follow SCU’s academic integrity policies.
